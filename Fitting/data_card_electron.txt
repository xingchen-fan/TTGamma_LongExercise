# now we list the expected events for signal and all backgrounds in that bin
# the second 'process' line must have a positive number for backgrounds, and 0 for signal.
# the line starting with 'rate' gives the expected yield for each process.
# Then (after the '-----'-line), we list the independent sources of uncertainties, and give their effect (syst. error)
# on each process and bin, in this case none.
